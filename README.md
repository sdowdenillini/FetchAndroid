Hello.
In order to use this application, make a copy of the repository and download it into Android Studio.
Then, run the application.
When using the application, click the buttons to get the list in either the original order given in the link, ordered by listID, or ordered by listID and name.
You can toggle between all of them easily!
Feel free to read the comments describing the code in MainActivity.java, as that is where most of the code was written.
